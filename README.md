# BlackJack
Project to work on in my spare time to learn C# and other technologies.

A blackJack game written in C# using Windows Forms.  Plan to add basic strategy training and a database with users and statistics.
I will try to add as many things as I can to this project as a way for me to learn new skills by actively programming them into 
this project.
